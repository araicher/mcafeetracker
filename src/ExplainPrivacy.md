# Is bitcoin enabling criminal activities?

Cash has always been a means of payment with a lot of privacy. You don't have to
reveal your identity if you want to send or receive cash. Two people exchanging
cash do not need the permission nor the help of a third party. They just hand over the money.

With cashless payment systems like credit cards, there is a third party (i.e. Bank) involved.
Your bank has the ability and obligation to track, report, cancel or revert payments.

Some people like surveillance and say that it is good because it helps the authorities catch criminals.
But is it worth losing your freedom and privacy? What if you live in a country with an evil government?

Bitcoin payments, though cashless, are peer-to-peer, permission less und irreversible.
Neither party needs to reveal his or her identity, only a payment address. As long as your transaction
is cryptographically correct, the bitcoin network will process it. No questions asked.

# I've heard that the fees are high

You move your bitcoins with an entry into the blockchain. Miners do that in an expensive process.
The sender creates a transaction in which he or she declares the amount to send to the recipient
and also a fee as a reward the miner who processes the transaction.

The sender is free chose the fee and the miner is free to pick the transactions.
Understandably, they take the ones with the higher fees first. These unprocessed
transactions are standing in line in the so called mempool.

If you chose a below average fee, you have to wait till the higher paying transactions
are cleared from the mempool.

Around November and December 2017, the mempool was incredibly full. Some say it was
a spam attack, others say it was incompetence of the senders who did not implement
space saving technologies like segwit or transaction bundling.

Right now, the mempool is pretty empty and even transactions with just a few Cents
worth of fees make it into the blockchain within a few hours.

If your wallet App does not give you the ability to send low priority transactions with a
low fee, think about switching or ask the developers to give you that choice.
